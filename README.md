In 2024, seniors either had midterms and a final, or just three exams (with no midterm or final). In 2025, it's only the latter.
- 0_GraderSolution_2025: Answers to 2025 grader problems
- 1_Exam1_2024: Problems and Answers to 2024 Exam1
- 2_Exam2_2024: Problems and Answers to 2024 Exam2
- 3_Midterm_2023: Problems and Answer to 2023 Midterm exam

All of the solutions in this repo were timed during each attempt, so not all of the code is well-written or fully optimized. It was written in a rushed, speedrun manner, so don't expect it to have the lowest possible time complexity.

This Notion link, shared by seniors, provided me an advance access to the 2024 grader problems and their well-written solutions. Note that the 2025 version is different, as some problems were changed, added, or removed.
